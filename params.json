{"name":"Nim-teafiles","tagline":"","body":"Nim TeaFiles\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a Nim library to read and write [TeaFiles](http://discretelogics.com/teafiles/).\r\n\r\nTeaFiles provide fast read/write access to time series data from any software\r\npackage on any platform. Time Series are considered homogeneous collections of\r\nitems, ordered by their timestamp. Items are stored in raw binary format, such\r\nthat data can be memory mapped for fast read/write access. In order to ensure\r\ncorrect data interpretation when data is exchanged between multiple applications,\r\nTeaFiles optionally embedd a description of the data layout in the file header,\r\nalong with other optional description of the file's contents.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere is not much in terms of documentation yet, but you can have a look at\r\n\r\n* the [tests usage](https://github.com/unicredit/nim-teafiles/blob/master/test.nim)\r\n* the [API docs](http://unicredit.github.io/nim-teafiles/api.html)\r\n* the [original TeaFiles spec](http://discretelogics.com/resources/teafilespec/)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nUnlike the TeaFiles packages provided for other languages, this library is\r\nprovided under the [Apache2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\nThis is possible because it is a clean room implementation entirely derived\r\nfrom the [TeaFiles specification](http://discretelogics.com/resources/teafilespec/).\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe TeaFiles format was originally designed and developed by [DiscreteLogics](http://discretelogics.com).\r\nTeaFiles is a copyright by DiscreteLogics.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
